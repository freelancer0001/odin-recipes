        <h2>Description</h2>
        <h3>This strawberry rhubarb pie recipe is as fool-proof as can be and is really delicious. The crust is my grandmother's recipe. It's made with vegetable oil and milk blended into flour. It rolls out beautifully and is the perfect pastry to hold this delicious pie's rhubarb and strawberry filling.
<h2>List of Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2.25 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>0.5 cup vegetable oil</li>
                <li>6 tablespoons milk</li>
                <li>1.5 cups sliced fresh strawberries</li>
                <li>5 medium stalks rhubarb, cut into 1 1/2 inch pieces</li>
                <li>1.5 cups white sugar</li>
                <li>3.5 tablespoons instant tapioca</li>
                <li>1 pinch salt</li>
                <li>1.5 teaspoons ground nutmeg</li>
<h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>To make the crust: Combine flour and salt in a large bowl. Place oil in a 1 cup sized measuring cup and top with milk; do not mix. Pour oil and milk mixture over flour; blend with a fork until it forms a dough. Divide dough into 2 balls. Place one ball on a sheet of waxed paper. Top with another sheet of waxed paper and roll out to fit your pie plate. Repeat with remaining ball of dough. Peel top paper off of one crust and flip dough into pie plate. Peel off paper and press dough in. Save remaining dough for top crust.
</li>
<li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
<li>To make the filling: Mix rhubarb, strawberries, sugar, tapioca, salt, and nutmeg until fruit is well coated. Pour filling into prepared crust and dot with butter. Cover with top crust; flute the edges to seal, then cut several slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape.

</li>
<li>Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Reduce temperature to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) and continue to bake for an additional 20 minutes. Let pie cool before cutting.</li>
